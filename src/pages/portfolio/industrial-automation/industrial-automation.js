        <p>
          For 13 years I have worked in the field of industrial automation.
          During this time I have written C#, Java and VBA applications. Not to
          mention to countless PLC programs I have written as well. I don't
          mention this work as much because I want this site to be more about
          web applications. Increasily however,these two worlds are starting to
          meet.
